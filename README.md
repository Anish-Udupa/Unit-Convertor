# Unit-Convertor
My 1st Semester Python project.  
A small application which is programmed to convert from one unit to another of the same physical quantity.      
The physical quantities available are temperature, currency and distance.   
The above application is built using the python tkinter module.   
Feel free to download and use, modify as well as redistribute.
